# Most searched programming languages by tag on stackoverflow 2004 - 2018
Anyone who has worked with programming languages knows how helpful platforms such as Stack overflow are.By using appropriate tags, we gain access to a treasure trove of knowledge which are answers of other users who struggled with similar problems.

I want to find out how often R and Python and their libraries have been searched over time. I also want to compare R and Python to other programs that enable data analysis. Also to see which languages were most searched in the period 2008 - 2018.
I hope you enjoy this simple analysis.
